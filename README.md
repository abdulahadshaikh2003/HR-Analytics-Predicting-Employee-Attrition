# HR Analytics â€“ Predicting Employee Attrition

## Project Overview
This project analyzes HR data to uncover attrition patterns and predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.  
It combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Machine Learning Models**, **SHAP Explainability**, and an interactive **Power BI Dashboard**.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- SHAP (Model Interpretability)
- Power BI (Dashboard Visualization)

---

## Key Insights
- **Attrition by Department**: Higher in Sales and R&D.
- **Attrition vs Salary**: Lower salaries strongly linked to attrition.
- **Attrition vs Promotions**: New hires & employees without promotion more likely to leave.
- **Attrition vs Tenure**: Higher in the first 10 years.
- **SHAP Analysis**: Monthly Income, Years at Company, and Age are strongest predictors.
